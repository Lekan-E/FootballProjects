### AFCON Shot Map Project
In this project, I work with data provided by Statsbomb to create an interactive shotmap for the 2023 AFCON. The visualization accounts for the following shot outcomes, a goal, a shot off target and a shot saved by the goalkeeper.
It also provides key information about the quality of the shots using the following metrics, Expected Goal (xG), xG Differential (Goal - xG) and xG per Shot.

Tools used: 
Python - To access the Statsbomb API,
Tableau - To create data visualizations and dashboards.
