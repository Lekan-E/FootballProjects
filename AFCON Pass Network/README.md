### Pass Network Analysis
This visualization shows the pass network for Nigeria during the AFCON Final vs Cote d'Ivoire, showing Nigeria's reaction to conceeding in the 61st minute.

- 1-61st Minute:
Score: Nigeria 1-0 Cote d'Ivoire
Observations:
Nigeria displayed a balanced and spread-out formation across the field.
The play was primarily concentrated in their half, with only Victor Osimhen (9) positioned in the opposition half to initiate and drive the attack.
This strategy was effective until the 61st minute, when Cote d'Ivoire scored.

- 62-97th Minute:
Score: Nigeria 1-2 Cote d'Ivoire
Observations:
After conceding goals in the 61st and 80th minutes, Nigeria increased their number of passing connections.
This suggests more possession and intricate play as they searched for an equalizing goal.
Despite their efforts, they were unable to score again, resulting in a 1-2 loss in the final.

Uses:
- Helps in identifying which players are central to the team's passing strategy and who are the primary distributors of the ball.
- Players can use the network to understand their positioning and connectivity on the field, helping them to improve their decision-making and movement.
Coaches can use it to understand how well the team is executing their game plan. For example, if the strategy was to play through the wings but the network shows central dominance, adjustments may be needed.
