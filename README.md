# Football Projects
Here are a couple projects I've worked on as a fan of football/soccer to apply data to the sport. The repository contains tools and files to collect, analyzr and visualize football statistics. My main objective is to help myself and others understand the game better using data, understand the analytics side of football and improve my Python and Tableau skills in data analysis and science. My aim is to create 2 projects a month.

Data Collection: To get the data, I work with open data provided by StatsbombAPI and I use various webscraping techniques. Then I store in a SQL database for future statistical analysis and visualizations.

Data Visualization: For visuzalition, I use Tableau and Python to help users interpret the data. Creating visuals like Shot Map, Heat Map, Match Momentum and many more.
