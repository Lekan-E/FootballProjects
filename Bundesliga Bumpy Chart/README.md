# Bumpy Chart
### The goal is to create a visual representation of each team's ranking during each game week of the 2023/2024 season.

The use case of this chart is to:
- Allow users to see how each team's ranking has flunctuated throughout the season.
- Highlight dramatic changes in a team's position, such as a sudden drop or rise in form. This can indicate a manager change or a change in tactics.
- Identify teams that have maintained a steady position at the top or bottom of the league table.
- Compare performance trends of different teams.
