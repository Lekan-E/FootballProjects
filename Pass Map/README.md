# Pass Map
### The goal is to visualize all the passes made by a player in a game, using different colors to represent the final status of each pass.

Use Cases:
- Evaluate the passing performance of a player, including distribution and accuracy.
- Analyze and identify players areas of improvement, such as accuracy, pass selection i.e whether the player can improve on their short, lateral passes or long, forward passes.
- For scouting and recruitment, it helps a team determine if a player fits a particular playing style or system by analyzing their passing behaviour.

Tools:
- Python: To get the event data using Statsbombpy. (code included)
- Tableau: For visualization
